## Run it yourself

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/murraypatterson/minic)](https://repl.it/github/murraypatterson/minic)

*Note: that repl.it can seem to hang on the "detecting language" part,
but just click "reload" on your browser, and it seems to resolve that
problem, click "Run" and enjoy!
